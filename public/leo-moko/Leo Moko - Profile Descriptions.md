I'm a visionary with a passion for philosophy, always looking for ways to challenge the status quo and make a meaningful impact.

As a software engineer, I prioritize fundamentals and adapt to new technologies and methodologies. Recently, I've developed a fascination with team dynamics, company culture, and source code management, including decision logs and workflow. I believe that focusing on small, nitty-gritty activities can enable a team to think of enhancements rather than minor adjustments.

My goal is to create an environment that inspires software teams to exceed beyond office perks, and I'm adept at communicating with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Born and raised in Cape Town, South Africa, Liyolo Metsing Moko is a dynamic individual with a diverse cultural background. He is the product of a mix between a Xhosa mother and a Sotho father, Thobeka Moko and Kitwell Moko, respectively. His mother named him Liyolo, which means "my peace" in Xhosa, but his father named him Metsing, which means "a watery place" in Sotho, due to the rain on the day he was born in 1996.

Growing up in Nyanga East, one of Cape Town's most crime-ridden townships, Liyolo attended Andile Primary School before moving to Khayelitsha Kwezi Park to finish his primary and high school education at Sivile Primary School and Zola Business School, respectively. He completed his tertiary education at Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) where he studied Information Technology, majoring in Software Development.

Liyolo's passion for creating things and identifying gaps in the business world led him to work as a Technical Programmer at Woolworths IT before he ventured out to start his own businesses. Although he faced challenges in the early stages of his entrepreneurial journey, including a lack of experience and resources, Liyolo persevered and eventually decided to pause and grow as a leader.

Now with a wealth of experience under his belt, Liyolo is back in the industry and committed to making a positive impact through his work.

My name is Liyolo Metsing Moko, a Sotho child raised by my Xhosa grandmother in Nyanga East, Cape Town. I grew up in a township with a high crime rate and attended schools such as Andile Primary School, Sivile Primary School, and Zola Business School. At the age of 20, I completed my studies at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT), majoring in Software Development.

My fascination for creating things and identifying gaps in the business world led me to work at Woolworths IT as a Technical Programmer from 2016 to 2017. However, I felt it was time to pursue my own path and execute on my ideas. I founded my own start-ups but faced several challenges, including a lack of funding and capacity. As a result, I decided to pause and focus on growing as a leader.

Today, I am back in the industry, gaining a more solid foundation before pursuing my entrepreneurial ventures once again. My experiences have taught me valuable lessons about leadership and the importance of having a strong team to execute on ideas. I am passionate about learning and consuming content and am always looking for opportunities to grow both personally and professionally.
