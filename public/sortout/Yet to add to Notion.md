# Life Experiences

- How you present yourself to others is critical.
- People assess a tree by the fruits it bears, not by what it says.
- People cannot read your mind; you must present yourself in order for others to know who you are.
- It is your daily activities that will determine your level of achievement in life. Doing the little things correctly.
- Your calling is what irritates you.
- Continue to invest in yourself.
- Focus on one item at a time.
- Never borrow money without considering cash flow.
- Have cash flow, then eat the profit after saving a portion of it.
- Always be Leo Moko; whoever imitates you is not your issue.
- Remove all distractions and concentrate
- Move out and step out of your comfort zone when you're 18 years old.
- Never succumb to a situation; if you're not learning, don't relax.

Workflow etc. It’s the small actions that produce a bigger return.

# History

On a wet day in Cape Town in 1996, I was born about 08:30. Because of the rain, my father named me Metsing, which means "watery place." Bread made by a Xhosa mother and a Sotho father, Thobeka Moko (Domestic Worker), and Kitwell Moko (Security Guard). My mother, Thobeka, named me Liyolo (iliyolo lam), and I am now Liyolo Metsing Moko. A Sotho youngster reared Xhosa by his grandmother in Cape Town's Nyanga East township, the township with the highest crime rate. I began my academic career in Andile Primary School (Grade R - Grade 3). I went from Nyanga East to Khayelitsha Kwezi Park to live with my parents, where I completed the majority of my elementary school (Silive elementary School) and high school (Zola Business School).
I graduated from high school at the age of 17 and attended CPUT (Cape Peninsular University of Technology) for my NB: Information Technology specializing in Software Development (2014-2016).
I've always been fascinated by making things and identifying gaps in the business sector, and I've been learning as much as I enjoy consuming knowledge. Woolworths IT was my first employer, where I worked as a Technical Programmer (2016-2017).
I quit after a year because I felt it was time for me to forge my own path and pursue my ideas (dreams) and the enterprises I've been interested in starting since I was a child. I accomplished it, but with little experience or excitement. I did a lot because I had too much on my plate, and my staff wasn't fully committed to the hustle since I wouldn't let them leave because there wasn't any cash in place to fund these start-ups. Yes, I was winning clients, but capacity was an issue, and we ended up missing deadlines, so I chose to PAUSE and GROW as a leader. There was a lot of growth during that fight. Decided to return to the industry for Round 2.

## Summary

Most of these interviews and ted talk are in different sectors. Interviews – Are more focused in the business world, tech start-ups and mostly learning from CEOs and successful people. Ted-Talks – Are focus on self-improvements as a person that wants to be a leader and a person of value to the world at large.

### Ted Talks

### Lean (Method) in a workplace

- Remove waste as much as possible
- Remove any that doesn’t provide value to the customer
- Lean does go deep to a level of sorting out your files and folders.
  - Also on a level of coding standards, the mind-set is to eliminate all tasks that are waste or that are not bringing any value to the customer.
    - By that I mean, you need to have a structure that can enabled the team to provide value to the customer at a quick rate.
- Keep on improving the process in how we can make it a lovely experience for developers and other teams. Focus on the processes , what works well and what should be removed or what is waste

  - Questions to ask: What value does this step provide
- Make is easy for people do to their job/work. Or you can just make everything easy

### Communication

- Email
  - This can be a huge waste in an organisation where by individual can send a long email and the recipient can tell what is said.
  - A person can send a short email which can end up being a back and forth with recipient
    - One has to fine the balance whereby you can construct an email, and the recipient can clarify things for you with a one liner.
- Waiting

  - The whole thing with having to wait on a response has to be eliminated.
    - People need to be quick, continuous communication, focusing on small tasks and sh!!T.

- Checklists are important in the lean management world.
  - One task at a time , the is no such thing as multitasking

### CI/CD

_Continuous delivery or continuous deployment_

- Big changes fail , It’s important to look at small changes
- Quick return around , in identifying issues (Small batches) //a lot of people are busy but they are not efficient

If the is no one in charge then you are

### Zero- billion – Dollar Company – by Vinod Khosla

- A company becomes the people it hires, not the plan it makes.
- When building a billion-dollar company you are actually climbing Mount Everest
  - You don’t climb Mount Everest on a straight line, you breakdown your climb and you climb based on basecamps.
- In the start-up business, you have to take things step by step, focus on millstones. Don’t be in the mind-set of raising a lot of money. Raise money based on achieving the millstones up ahead. It approve can help you with validated learning. The other advantage with this that you will have less investors in your board table and you would see yourself losing control of your company to please investors that have an negative impact to the company.
  - It give you the power to let go of such investors and seek for newer ones.
- Investor
  - Investors can add negative value to the company even though they have invested
    - They can drive you crazy , if worse if they not experienced in building a big company from zero
- Co-founders
  - Be generous and give out shares of your company to your co-founders.
- Key In People
- Create opportunities for people , that can benefit in attracting talent
- Business

  - The isn’t one formula everyone has their own path
  - Copying those that have won, you won’t gain anything from that, study them don’t copy them.

- Built an monopoly

### Decision Making

- If the board or the CEO have to make a decision then the is a problem with the company processes
- One product at a time.
- Work on your communications skills – It’s not about how your communicate , but more for how other hear you or how they communicate
- Structured process and structure product, but within the workplaces people must do as they please, just come with results, fuck 9-5. Create a culture where everything is documented , a person can be able to do their work
  - Employ self-motivate individuals that can self-manage themselves.

### Workplace

- Have a mind-set of capturing everything. so that the next person doesn’t have to ask the same question asked in the past
  - Something stackoverflow but within the company.
- To the deepest level like where are the toilets
- Have above process based on lean management
  - On-boarding – what you have to do and who has to do what for you

### YC Founders

- Great founders execute they do what they said they were going to do.
- Be able to explain what your business does to your mother, customer, and investor to everything. You must able to explain it in simple form of words.
  - That one main thing that your business does (Root)
- Always remember the why don’t get discouraged.

### System Change

The current system that we live by doesn’t enable us to be humans beings, it pollutes us to into this small box of thinking. We unable to express ourselves and live up to our purpose we actually forget and we submit to what is in front of us. This needs to change, we have to open things up. Execute, we need freedom. This is a beautifully world which we need to explore and discover new things about earth and human beings. The is a lot to discover/uncover.

### Relationship as a Men

- Be happy with yourself, work on yourself and respect yourself.
- Keep things fun , have activities that you do with your partner and also with by yourself and friends
- Be busy, work on something you are passionate about.

### Handling Space

### Technologies

#### All technologies I have self-studied

Vue.js vs React.js vs Angular.js

- Vue.js
  - If you want to build an application or website without wanting to know the fine details about the frontend , then vue.js is for you
  - It is more for backend developers rather than frontend like developers
- Angular.js
  - Full packaged framework for building enterprise at a large scale

#### Library vs Framework

-     Library – Provides you with prebuild code that you can choose from.
  - Everything is already build for you, you just need to call and use it as you please.
- Framework – Is set of way of building your application or system.
  - Set of rules and measure you have to submit too, It is very limited or I doesn’t allow you to do as you please

#### React vs React Native

- React is a library
- React Native is a mobile framework

#### Git vs Github

- Git – Version control software
- Github – Added layer on GIT but tis just a website for GIT same as Bitbucket and Gitlab

#### Programming Tips from others

_Tips I have received from YouTube videos and articles I have read_

##### Developer rules by stef

- Master the fundamentals of programming
- Don’t marry a language or a framework
- Focus on what’s on the market rather than what is it that you prefer as a developer
- All those technologies these days are the same , they are good
- Choose a technology best on the project
- Be on a need to learn basis.

#### Change in a workplace

- Next, as you devise a strategy for change consider a patient approach that leaves enough time for a change in mind-set to proceed a change in skillsets. This is so critical.

#### Law of Attraction & Manifesting

- Visions – be a visionary
- Believe, believe, it’s here it’s here
